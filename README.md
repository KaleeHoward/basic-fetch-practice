**Module 3, Week 3 Assignment**
**"Basic Fetch Practice"**

*Code:You Web Development Pathway*

Overview
In this assignment, we will practice using the fetch API by making a callout to a statically hosted JSON file and using the returned data. In this case, the JSON file contains a list of objects representing users and we will be dynamically creating "cards" for user containing information about them.
